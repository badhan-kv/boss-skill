# Use instead of plain "ssh" from the Windows PC: opens the SSH session as usual and, while it is
# open, opens a view for every boss worker on the Linux machine: the ones already running, and
# each new one the boss spawns from this SSH session. A worker's view closes when the worker ends;
# closing it only closes the view, the worker keeps running.
# Run inside Windows Terminal: the SSH session stays in the current tab, each worker gets a tab in
# the same window and focus goes back to tab -BossTab (default 0, the first tab; Windows Terminal
# cannot open a tab in the background, so focus is moved back by tab number). Run from a classic
# console window with Windows Terminal installed: the SSH session moves to the first tab of a new
# Windows Terminal window. Without Windows Terminal: each worker gets its own PowerShell window.
# Works over any network path to the host: the SSH session and the tab feed are matched by a random
# id (BOSS_TAB_ID), not by IP address.
# Needs key-based SSH login (the background feed cannot type a password).
# Usage: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File boss-ssh.ps1 [user@host]
